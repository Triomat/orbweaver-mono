# Specification Quality Checklist: Interface Type/Speed Mismatch Fix

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-05-08  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items verified. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Notes

- Bug is narrowly scoped to interface type/speed classification during discovery
- Three prioritized user stories address: correctness (P1), backward compatibility (P2), observability (P3)
- Success criteria are measurable with clear before/after metrics
- Assumption about interface naming conventions is documented
- Edge cases identified but not overspecified (defer to planning phase)
